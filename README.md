💰 Expense Tracker Mobile App Backend
📝 What's This All About?
Welcome to the backend for a mobile app that helps you keep track of your money! This project is the brain behind a mobile expense tracker, built with Java and Spring Boot. It handles all the important stuff like managing user accounts, and tracking both personal and group expenses. Whether you're splitting a dinner bill with friends or just keeping an eye on your own spending, this backend has you covered!

🚀 What Can It Do?
Personal & Group Expenses: It can handle two types of expenses: your own personal ones, and shared expenses for a group of people.

Full CRUD Operations: You can easily Create, Read, Update, and Delete expenses and groups.

Database Connection: It uses MongoDB as the database to store all the data, which is perfect for this kind of app.

Web Interfaces: It's set up to communicate with the mobile app through web requests, making it a true backend service.

⚙️ What's Under the Hood?
This project is a backend service and uses some powerful technologies.

Java: The main programming language for all the logic.

Spring Boot: A fantastic framework that makes building web applications with Java super fast and easy.

MongoDB: A flexible NoSQL database that we're using to store all the expense data.

Maven: This is our project manager that handles all the dependencies and builds.

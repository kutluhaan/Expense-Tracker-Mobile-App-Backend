# Expense-Tracker-Mobile-App-Backend
In this backend project, I have implemented the backend side of a mobile app which tracks the users' expenses using Java, and its interfaces. In the backend side, I have used MongoDB as my database and used web dependency to send requests to web. In this mobile app, there are two ways of expenses, group expenses which assumes a group of people having expenses and their both individual and group expenses are shown are handled and personal expenses which trakcs the a user's own expenses.

Adding, deleting, updating and many more methods are available for both group and personal sides.
